v1.0f
===================================================================================
- add: osp_realisticDamage &lt;0|1&gt; (voteable)
       Truly real world damage, rules are:
       - grenades do double damage
       - bullets all do 95 damage when hitting arms,hands,feet,lower legs
       - bullets do 100 damage when hitting tighs,waist,chest,neck,head
       - bullets hitting the armor covered area of the body (chest,waist,tighs) 
         take a random amount of armor away from 0 to 99 and the rest is taken from
         health (M60 and MSG rifle are unnaffected by armor)
       - knockback is 25% of the default knockback
       Note: This is not meant as a replacement to the inconsistent sof2.wpn (usually
       in a pk3 file named zrest.pk3 or something) real damage package thats already 
       out there, this is a package for people who would like to play a faster paced game
       where everybody has a fair chance at scoring some kills. If you use the osp 
       realistic damage you can be 100% certain that no other modifications are being 
       used, like for instance making one weapon (the server admin's favorite?) deal 
       some extra damage...
- add: new toggleable command +stats (like +scores for scores) will show hit location 
       percentiles of where you hit the most, and where you've been hit the most
       Note: the hit location percentiles are also shown during the award ceremony       
- add: osp_enemyKillReport &lt;0|1&gt; (default: enabled, always disabled in g_doWarmup 2)
       will tell you the remaining health/armor of the player who just killed you
       (for public servers)
- add: bots are now enabled, you can do /addbot mullins, I haven't touched the bot code
       at all so they're a little dumb in complex team gametypes, but they're ok in 
       deathmatch       
- add: balanceteams command/vote added, can be called from rcon or by a regular vote
       will balance teams by using players' kill/death ratio as the sorting value

- chg: removed default filter behavior on target_speakers that was removing all 
       target_speakers when using altmaps that replace sounds
- chg: moved most of the weapons data for sof2++ in the data/sof2++.wpn file so it can
       be modified
- chg: increased reach multiplier from 1.25 to 1.35 so melee hits are easier to do for
       osp_modversion 1 and 2
- chg: replaced most sprees award with best score   
- chg: callvote weapononly <weapon_num> (introduced in 1.0e, forgot to mention it!)

       the default sof2 client from loading
- fix: sprees not resetting when doing a team kill, and spree displaying in obituary when 
       at 0 and team killing   
              
v1.0e
===================================================================================
- add: new individual scoring points in gametype vip

       and pickup, like so disable_sof2pp_pickup_weapon_***
       
       
v1.0d
===================================================================================

- add: consolidated osp/osp++/sof2++ versions, they can be switched to with osp_modversion CVAR
       osp_modversion 0 -&gt; vanilla sof2
       osp_modversion 1 -&gt; osp++
       osp_modversion 2 -&gt; sof2++
- add: osp_weaponsFile cvar which specifies the weapons file parsed, this will allow
       server admins that run weapons modification to quickly switch between files with
       just a quick map_restart
       i.e.: set osp_weaponsFile "ext_data/my_L33T_RealDamage_file.wpn" and then switch
       to regular damage mode by just typing /reset osp_weaponsFile
       Note: this will only work in regular OSP and OSP++ (not sof2++)
- add: killing spree system ... :D (a killing spree is 5 consecutive kills without dying)

- chg: cheat protected pmove_fixed and pmove_msec

       M590_INACCURACY      0.0f
       M590_MAXINACCURACY   0.5f
       M590_SPREAD          1.5f
       USAS_INACCURACY      0.05f
       USAS_MAXINACCURACY   0.75f
       USAS_SPREAD          1.75f

- fix: picking up a backpack while having an m203 waiting for a reload wouldnt give 2 
       m203s back
- fix: picking up m203's while waiting for reload

- chg: changed team info interval from 1 second to 2.5 
- fix: client was asking for osp scores on unpure older versions, or servers with client disabled
- fix: fixed cvarcheck command, added delay on client before sending info to avoid command flood
- add: added version check to loading screen, will now warn if server is running a different 
       version, either older or newer       
                     
              
v0.3f
====================================================================================
*** IMPORTANT CHANGES ***
- add: sv_ospClient cvar (defaults to 1) make it 0 and delete the osp-clientside-0.3*-BETA.pk3
       file from your server to run a true serverside only OSP server with the 0.3 version of OSP
- fix: profiled much of the sof2 code and found out where it was having a hard time, so I
       optimized some function calls that were cpu hungry       
- add: g_enhancedBugFixes (defaults to 0), temporary CVar to enable the new bug fixes and the
       enhancements they require in order for them to be balanced
       NOTE: this cvar lets you be able to run your server in line with your leagues or ladders, 
       and also lets you test the proposed fixes to Sof2, comments and suggestions will be welcomed
       on http://www.orangesmoothie.org in the Sof2 forums
       
*** CHANGES THAT REQUIRE G_ENHANCEDBUGFIXES TO BE ENABLED ***
- fix: shotguns and melee weapons now hit crouched players (crouch lean bug)
       NOTE: in order to fix this problem some of the shotgun's stats had to be readjusted, the shotgun
       will "feel" different because the hit detection of each pellet is now done like the rifle bullets
       meaning that they have to hit the "real" player model (hence fixing the crouch and leaning no-hits)       
       Also the shotguns will fire innacurately when jumping (like the other weapons)
       M590_INACCURACY      0.0f
       M590_MAXINACCURACY   1.5f
       M590_SPREAD          1.5f
       USAS_INACCURACY      0.5f
       USAS_MAXINACCURACY   2.0f
       USAS_SPREAD          1.75f
- fix: all projectiles now hit leaning players where they should, in default Sof2 all projectiles
       go through someone who is leaning, not anymore
       i.e.: projectiles can now wiz by your head if they dont hit your actual player model, 
       grenades can be thrown between legs instead of bouncing on an invisible wall in front of 
       the player, etc.
- add: client: "osp_useKeyForLadders", option to have to press the use key to grab ladders, 
       disabled by default
- add: m4 rifles's m203 cannon does not reload automatically any longer, you need to press the alternate

       and the game is paused by an admin
- chg: removed the 6th line of the MOTD in order to have a line to inform players about the bug fixes       
- add: "osp_oldConsole", disabled by default, switches the console background to the default sof2 one

       The server administrator can add admins by going ingame and doing /addadmin id#
       or remove them by doing /removeadmin id#, the admins are determined by their GUID
       keys, so it is essential that punkbuster be running. The admins are held in a text
       file specified by g_adminFile, which defaults to "sof2.admins". You can edit this file

       NOTE: Admins can also spectate any player, while playing, make sure no admins are playing
       in official matches, thats what referees are for.
