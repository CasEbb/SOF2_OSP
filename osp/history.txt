v1.0f
===================================================================================
- add: osp_realisticMode <0|1> (voteable)
       Truly real world damage, rules are:
       - grenades do double damage
       - bullets all do 95 damage when hitting arms,hands,feet,lower legs
       - bullets do 100 damage when hitting tighs,waist,chest,neck,head
       - bullets hitting the armor covered area of the body (chest,waist,tighs) 
         take a random amount of armor away from 0 to 99 and the rest is taken from
         health (M60 and MSG rifle are unnaffected by armor)
       - knockback is 25% of the default knockback
       Note: This is not meant as a replacement to the inconsistent sof2.wpn (usually
       in a pk3 file named zrest.pk3 or something) real damage package thats already 
       out there, this is a package for people who would like to play a faster paced game
       where everybody has a fair chance at scoring some kills. If you use the osp 
       realistic damage you can be 100% certain that no other modifications are being 
       used, like for instance making one weapon (the server admin's favorite?) deal 
       some extra damage...
- add: osp_realisticRespawnInt default:8 seconds
       since waiting in realistic mode happens alot more...       
- add: new toggleable command +stats (like +scores for scores) will show hit location 
       percentiles of where you hit the most, and where you've been hit the most
       Note: the hit location percentiles are also shown during the award ceremony       
- add: osp_enemyKillReport <0|1> (default: enabled, always disabled in g_doWarmup 2)
       will tell you the remaining health/armor of the player who just killed you
       (for public servers)
- add: bots are now enabled, you can do /addbot <botname>, I haven't touched the bot code
       at all so they're a little dumb in complex team gametypes, but they're ok in 
       deathmatch
       Note: You need to get botfiles, since I don't have any and I don't want to step
       on anyone's toes, I recommend getting the ones from the Mandown mod, you'll get two 
       directories named botfiles and botroutes, you need to put them under the osp
       directory for bots to work
- add: balanceteams command/vote added, can be called from rcon or by a regular vote
       will balance teams by using players' kill/death ratio as the sorting value

- chg: removed default filter behavior on target_speakers that was removing all 
       target_speakers when using altmaps that replace sounds
- chg: moved most of the weapons data for sof2++ in the data/sof2++.wpn file so it can
       be modified
- chg: increased reach multiplier from 1.25 to 1.35 so melee hits are easier to do for
       osp_modversion 1 and 2
- chg: replaced most sprees award with best score   
- chg: callvote weapononly <weapon_num> (introduced in 1.0e, forgot to mention it!)
       play a round with only the selected weapon, type callvote weapononly ? to see what
       the weapon numbers are

- fix: sof2++ additionnal weapons hurting players in invulnerability time

       the default sof2 client from loading

       at 0 and team killing       
      

v1.0e
===================================================================================
- add: new individual scoring points in gametype vip
       killing someone who's hurt your vip in the last 5 seconds gives 3 points
       killing the vip gives 5 points
       vip killing enemy players gets 3 points
- chg: removed broken RD filters in the ingame browser, i recommend using All Seeing Eye!

- note: disabling weapons in sof2++ requires setting cvars that have sof2pp between disable
       and pickup, like so disable_sof2pp_pickup_weapon_***


v1.0d
===================================================================================

- add: consolidated osp/osp++/sof2++ versions, they can be switched to with osp_modversion CVAR
       osp_modversion 0 -> vanilla sof2
       osp_modversion 1 -> osp++
       osp_modversion 2 -> sof2++
- add: osp_weaponsFile cvar which specifies the weapons file parsed, this will allow
       server admins that run weapons modification to quickly switch between files with
       just a quick map_restart
       i.e.: set osp_weaponsFile "ext_data/my_L33T_RealDamage_file.wpn" and then switch
       to regular damage mode by just typing /reset osp_weaponsFile
       Note: this will only work in regular OSP and OSP++ (not sof2++)
- add: killing spree system ... :D (a killing spree is 5 consecutive kills without dying)

- chg: skill removed from awards, replaced with number of killing sprees
- chg: cheat protected pmove_fixed and pmove_msec
